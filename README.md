# TSP-Genetic-Crossover-Comparator

A visualization of the Travelling Sales Person solved by Genetic Algorithms.

The ultimate goal of this project serves a research purpose, which is to benchmark different Crossover operators relative to the number of vertices on the graph, among other factors.

Was built using Godot Engine for C# Mono.
